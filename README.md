# RateMyLandlord
```Made at HackTheValley 4, Winner of Best use of MongoDB ``` 

I worked with a group of students in a hackathon to develop a web-app called RateMyLandlord. We all had the unfortunate experience of having a bad landlord during a study term, and the stress can sometimes take a toll from the negligence of one. RateMyLandlord is a streamlined way for past tenants to share experiences with landlords and their respective properties. The data for landlords and addresses were stored using MongoDB, the backend was made with Node.js. The frontend was made using Javascript, Bootstrap, EJS, and HTML. Google Maps API was used to display each location on the map.



I learned a lot about HTML and web-app development via the completion of this project. I personally faced many challenges as I never was comfortable with JavaScript/Node.js. MongoDB was also relatively new to me. I am proud that we won and completed the project. The project opened my eyes to the work that I need to do so that I feel more comfortable with back-end development.
